RAG systems aim to improve memory recall and management by integrating temporal representations into memory vectors, allowing for more nuanced handling of temporal and contextual dynamics. These systems dynamically update memory connections using techniques like dynamic time warping and employ a propagation control mechanism to ensure efficient recall by limiting stimuli spread. In an agentic world, RAG systems interact by autonomously recalling relevant memories for response generation, managing memory significance in a temporal context similar to human memory recall, and enhancing the cognitive abilities of dialogue agents within context-aware dialogue AI systems.\n",
